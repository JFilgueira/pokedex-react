# Pokedéx with React.js

## Project's Scope
This was the first project with React.js that I've made on my own, and knowing that in terms of funcionality there wasn't much to do with the info besides show it in a kind static way, I've tried to add a couple of things to give more life to the app as the favorite functionality, dark mode, the other pages that bahave like popups and things like that. I had great time doin it and I hope you too have using it! Wanted to start simples but efficiently

* List Pokémons basic info in cards
* View detailed info of each Pokémon
* Favorite Pokémons
* Search Pokémon by it's Name
* Dark mode
* Responsive design
* [Live preview on Vercel](https://pokedex-react-flax.vercel.app/)
